Critical data flows support real-time processing:
- Streaming architecture for time-sensitive data
- Prioritization mechanisms for urgent processing
- Progressive processing for large data volumes
- Event-driven triggers for immediate analysis

### Data Quality
Multiple mechanisms ensure high data quality:
- Input validation at ingestion
- Normalization during processing
- Anomaly detection for unusual data
- Consistency checks across data sources
- Source credibility scoring

### Privacy and Security
Data protection is built into the pipeline design:
- Sensitive data encryption
- Access control at each processing stage
- Anonymization where appropriate
- Retention policies for data lifecycle management
- Audit trails for all data access

This data processing pipeline enables the system to transform diverse raw data into the structured, contextualized information required for intelligent autonomous operation, while maintaining scalability, performance, and security.
