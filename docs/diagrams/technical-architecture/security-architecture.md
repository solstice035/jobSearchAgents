## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls protect critical assets:
- Overlapping defense mechanisms
- No single point of failure
- Complementary controls
- Independent security layers
- Comprehensive coverage

### Least Privilege
Access is limited to the minimum required:
- Function-based access grants
- Time-limited privileges
- Context-aware access control
- Regular access review
- Default deny stance

### Data-Centric Security
Security follows the data regardless of location:
- End-to-end data protection
- Data lifecycle security
- Location-independent controls
- User-controlled encryption (where possible)
- Data sovereignty respect

### Privacy by Design
Privacy protection is built into the system:
- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- Storage limitation
- User control and transparency
- Privacy impact assessment

### Continuous Improvement
Security evolves to address emerging threats:
- Regular security testing
- Threat intelligence monitoring
- Control effectiveness measurement
- Incident-driven improvements
- Security architecture reviews

This comprehensive security architecture ensures that the Agentic AI Job Search Assistant protects user data while maintaining system integrity and availability, building a foundation of trust that is essential for an autonomous career assistant.
