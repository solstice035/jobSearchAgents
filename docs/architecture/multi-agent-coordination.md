# Multi-Agent Coordination System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the multi-agent coordination system that enables integrated, autonomous operation across the job search platform. This system allows specialized agents to work together seamlessly, creating a cohesive user experience while maintaining separation of concerns.

## Agentic User Flow Coordination

The multi-agent system orchestrates the end-to-end user flow depicted in the agentic job search process diagram. This workflow integrates multiple specialized agents working asynchronously toward shared goals.

### Coordination Mechanisms

The agent coordination system employs several mechanisms to ensure smooth operation across the workflow:

1. **Event-Based Communication**
   - Agents publish events when significant milestones are reached
   - Other agents subscribe to relevant events to trigger dependent actions
   - Decouples agent implementations while maintaining process flow

2. **Shared Context**
   - Common memory system maintains user context across agents
   - Each agent contributes to and consumes from the shared context
   - Enables continuity without direct agent coupling

3. **Task Delegation**
   - Orchestrator delegates specialized tasks to appropriate agents
   - Tasks include required inputs and expected outputs
   - Agents work asynchronously on assigned tasks

4. **Status Reporting**
   - Agents report progress on long-running tasks
   - Status updates flow through to user interface
   - Enables visibility into background processes
