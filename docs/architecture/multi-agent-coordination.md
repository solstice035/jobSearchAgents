# Multi-Agent Coordination System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation plan for the multi-agent coordination system, a critical foundation feature enabling sophisticated automation across the job search platform.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Registry**
   - Central registration system for all agent types
   - Capability declaration and discovery
   - Agent lifecycle management
   - Health monitoring and status tracking

2. **Message Bus**
   - Asynchronous communication channel
   - Message routing and delivery
   - Event publication/subscription
   - Message persistence and recovery

3. **Task Orchestrator**
   - Task distribution and scheduling
   - Priority management
   - Dependency resolution
   - Resource allocation

4. **State Manager**
   - Distributed state management
   - Consistency maintenance
   - Transaction coordination
   - State recovery mechanisms

### Agent Types

1. **Document Processing Agent**
   - CV and cover letter analysis
   - Document formatting and optimization
   - Content extraction and validation

2. **Job Search Agent**
   - Job posting discovery
   - Requirement analysis
   - Opportunity matching
   - Application tracking

3. **User Preference Agent**
   - Profile management
   - Preference learning
   - Personalization
   - User interaction history

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Communication Framework
- Agent Registry implementation
- Basic Message Bus setup
- Simple task distribution
- Initial agent protocol definition

### Phase 2: Task Orchestration
- Queue management system
- Priority-based scheduling
- Basic error recovery
- Task state tracking

### Phase 3: Agent Specialization
- Role-based task distribution
- Capability registration
- Agent state management
- Cross-agent coordination

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Dynamic load balancing
- Fault tolerance
- Performance monitoring
- Cross-agent learning

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**
   - Message delivery latency < 100ms
   - Task distribution efficiency > 95%
   - System uptime > 99.9%

2. **Reliability**
   - Error recovery rate > 99%
   - Task completion success rate > 98%
   - State consistency maintenance > 99.9%

3. **Scalability**
   - Linear performance scaling up to 100 concurrent agents
   - Resource utilization optimization
   - Efficient load distribution

## Risk Mitigation

1. **System Failures**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - State recovery procedures

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Regular monitoring
   - Performance optimization
   - Resource management

3. **Coordination Complexity**
   - Clear protocol definitions
   - Simplified interaction patterns
   - Comprehensive logging

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Agent Registry
2. Set up basic Message Bus infrastructure
3. Implement initial agent protocol
4. Develop monitoring and logging system
