# Agentic AI Job Search Assistant Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for transforming the AI Career Coach & Job Search Agent into a fully autonomous agentic system. The focus is on end-to-end automation of the job search process with minimal user intervention required.

## Vision

Create an AI agent that autonomously manages the entire job search lifecycle - from analyzing user career goals and preferences, identifying relevant job opportunities, customizing application materials, preparing users for interviews, tracking application status, to providing strategic market insights.

## Current Status

The application currently operates as an assisted tool with the following functionality:

- Basic job search using the Perplexity API
- CV analysis and career coaching using OpenAI GPT-4o
- User preference storage and management
- Career roadmap generation
- Local deployment with Flask backend and React frontend
