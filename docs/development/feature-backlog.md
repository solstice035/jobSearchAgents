## Implementation Notes

### Revised Implementation Priorities
1. Simplify Multi-agent Coordination (F.3)
   - Focus on core agent interactions first
   - Implement basic coordination patterns
   - Defer complex multi-agent scenarios

2. Storage System Simplification
   - Use local storage for MVP
   - Document clear upgrade path to more sophisticated storage
   - Maintain data portability

3. Frontend Component Structure
   - Implement core UI components first
   - Focus on essential user interactions
   - Plan for progressive enhancement

4. Security Implementation
   - Prioritize essential security features
   - Document security roadmap
   - Regular security audits

### Documentation Alignment Tasks
1. Update architecture diagrams to reflect current implementation
2. Revise conversation flow documentation
3. Update job search integration documentation
4. Add implementation status to feature descriptions

### Next Steps
1. Complete partial implementations of P0 features
2. Revise complex features to simpler MVP versions
3. Update documentation to match implementation reality
4. Regular review of feature status and priorities
